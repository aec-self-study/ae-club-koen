## Major
* How to design and build a data model was good. Good details and tips for new and experienced users.

## Minor
* There is exercise for the Deployment Enviroments 

## Small
* Commandline Basics / Creating Files and Folders: Video shows wrong directories, not that problematic
* Commandline Basics / Enviroment Variables: $AEC is not available?
* There is no video for the Deployment Enviroments
